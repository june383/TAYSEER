Case Study: The Need for a Smart Wheelchair in Airports - Tayseer Project

To understand the real needs of travelers with disabilities, our team visited King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah and conducted on-ground interviews with airport staff, observing real travel experiences. This field research helped us identify key challenges such as limited self-service options, inconsistent staff availability, language barriers, and the lack of support outside terminal areas. In response, we developed Tayseer—a smart wheelchair system connected to a mobile app that empowers users to navigate independently, discreetly request help, switch languages, and even receive the chair at the pickup zone. The system is also designed to comply with airport security standards. Tayseer is more than just a tool—it's a step toward restoring dignity, confidence, and control to travelers. The full case study is attached above for a deeper look into our findings and solutions.
